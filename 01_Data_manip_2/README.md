# Data manipulation 2
Efficient data manipulation with dplyr and pipes

If you've done our first [data manipulation tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/06/data-manip-intro.html) and want to dig deeper into the `dplyr` package, this is for you!

#### 1. Chain together multiple lines of codes with pipes `%>%`

#### 2. Use `dplyr` to its full potential

#### 3. Automate advanced tasks like plotting without writing a loop

We'll play around with a subset of a large dataset of [trees within the Edinburgh council area](https://data.edinburghcouncilmaps.info/datasets/4dfc8f18a40346009b9fc32cbee34039_39). We have restricted it to the [Special Landscape Area](https://data.edinburghcouncilmaps.info/datasets/33969ec66f9b46cf9617c40c023bb89e_35) around Craigmillar Castle. __Both datasets are available under Governement Open License v3.0. Copyright City of Edinburgh Council, contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2019. The two datasets were accessed in April 2019.__
